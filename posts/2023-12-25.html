				Well I finally got around to building a website however, it's a little spartan
				at the moment. I'm not too sure what I'm going to put here. Probably start
				with some stuff I find interesting or funny and go from there. Or maybe I'll
				use it as a blog or something, Idk. Regardless, it's kind of cozy feeling to 
				have my own site. I'm not sure what about it I find so appealing but I quite 
				enjoy building out each part of the HTML and CSS source code. Anyways it's
				Christmas day as I write this so I'm just going to finish this first post here.
