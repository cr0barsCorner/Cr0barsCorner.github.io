				I have managed to secure a webserver for the node js backend! Turns out Render.com
				has a free tier that's perfect for what I'm trying to do. Now there is a small issue
				that being there is an idle time out and the 'disk' is non persistant. So after 15
				minutes without any api calls the box spools down and then the counter reverts to 
				the original state upon next start up. This kind of sucks but lukily the solution
				is relativly straight forwards. I have a small node js app running on a one of my
				local systems that just pings the server every 12-14 minutes. This keeps the 
				webserver from turning off and keeps the counter up to date. Now I just need some
				way to back up the data localy so if my account ever gets terminated or something
				happens I don't lose track of the visitor count. That's a problem for another day
				though. For now I'm happy with the results, and I didn't have to spend a dime! Now
				is this solution increadibly scuffed? 100% however I have never worked with any 
				sort of website networking like this so I'm kind of fumbling around in the dark.
				To be honest the fact that it works at all is kind of a miracle so I'm tempted to
				just leave it alone and not touch it. As far as I'm concered it's basically magic!
