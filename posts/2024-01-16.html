				Can't believe it's 2024 already. I feel like just last week I was excited to enter a new decade. 
				Well inspite of any existential panic that the passing of time has brought on, this year has still
				started off pretty good. I got a 3d printer finally so now I can make some minifigs. I think I am
				going to start with some warhammer 40k stuff, then maybe I'll make model rockets or something.
				I have wanted to get into 3d printing for quite a few years now, since 2015 or so. Always cost way
				too much however, this year I found the Ender 3 on sale so I decided fuck it, I'm not getting any
				younger, lets just grab one and start printing. For the moment I haven't even assembled it yet,
				it's just sitting in a box on my dresser top. When I do open it and get it printing I'll post some
				pics of the stuff I make.
