				So it's been a few days now and I got the basic functionalities worked out however I'm having some trouble with backend stuff.
				Some of you might notice the fact that this is a github pages site and be thinking to yourself "well obviously you are having
				trouble with backend, pages only supports static websites. What exactly did you think would happen?", and while you would be
				right about that, I have been working on a small node js server to use as the backend for this webpage. Nothing complicated,
				but static sites can be a little limiting. I can't do anything that involves dynamic data or data persistence as githut pages
				only serves content and doesn't provide any sort of computation. At the moment I have a visitor counter I just added to the 
				bottom of the main page but it's yet to function. I have been shopping around for a decent free server provider for the node 
				js server, but everything I have seen either has an insanely small limit on API calls (1k or less for the WHOLE MONTH!), or 
				is paid. Now granted, they aren't very expensive 9 times out of 10, I'm just trying to see if I can pull this off for free. 
				Maybe I will end up renting a cheap server from Amazon or something for a few bucks a month. Regardless, it's been kind of a pain.

				Now on the other end of things, I have been struggling to solidify a design. See, I still have no clue what I will ultimatly
				use this site for, and so deciding on a theme has been a bit difficult. Maybe I am just indecisive, but I keep seeing so many
				different and cool designs, I have no idea what to roll with. For the moment I have gone with a more space aesthetic look
				with some background images from or inspired by the anime Evangelion however, the font is still that 80's or 90's themed pixel
				art font. Maybe at some point I will get a cohesive design together. For now though this site will remain a hodge podge of ideas
				and poor design.
