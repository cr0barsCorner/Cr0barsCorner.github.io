				Welcome to my website, I'm Cr0bar, the admin of this site. I put this website
				together to have my own little corner of the internet. I also wanted to join
				a web ring and experience in a small way, how the internet used to be. There 
				isn't too much here at the moment, however I plan to post a variety of things 
				on this site. Mostly projects I work on, or things I find interesting. 
				Nothing fancy. Thanks for visitng!

				Web-ring? What is that?

				As mentioned above, this site is also part of something called a web ring.
				A web ring is just a group of websites that are all linked together in a 
				somewhat circular fashion and used to be popular before the internet went 
				truly mainstream and condensed into a handful of major sites.
